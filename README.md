Project Title
Iris Dataset Analysis using Seaborn

Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset, which is built directly into the Seaborn library.
The dataset contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Using Python and Seaborn, the notebook visualizes relationships between sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to understand how these features help differentiate species.

Objectives
Load the Iris dataset directly from Seaborn
Explore dataset structure and summary statistics
Visualize feature distributions and relationships
Identify patterns and correlations between features
Interpret how features separate different species visually
Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas – for data handling and manipulation
Seaborn – for visualization and built-in dataset access
Matplotlib – for plot customization
Setup Instructions
Install required libraries:

pip install seaborn pandas matplotlib
Open the notebook file:

jupyter notebook "Untitled (2).ipynb"
Run the notebook cells in order to view analysis and visualizations.

(Optional) Save figures or export insights as CSV.

Key Visualizations
Pairplot: Displays feature relationships across all Iris species
Boxplot: Compares distribution of features by species
Heatmap: Shows correlations between numerical features
Scatter Plot: Highlights feature variation among species
Insights
Iris-setosa is clearly separated from other species based on petal dimensions.
Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica overlap slightly but are distinguishable through combined petal measurements.
Petal features show a stronger correlation than sepal features.
Future Improvements
Add classification models such as Decision Tree or SVM to predict species.
Create an interactive visualization dashboard using Streamlit or Plotly.
Perform dimensionality reduction (PCA) for visualization.

Project Description
This project provides an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset using Python and Seaborn.
The Iris dataset is loaded directly from the Seaborn library, allowing for a simple and reproducible workflow.

Through visualization techniques like pair plots, box plots, and heatmaps, this analysis highlights how the petal and sepal features vary between the three Iris species.
The findings show clear separability of species based on petal dimensions and correlations among variables.

This notebook serves as an introductory example for learning data visualization and feature analysis in data science.
